                    <p>An ethical hacker, also known as a ‘white hat hacker’, is a cybersecurity professional who legally breaks into computers and networks to test an organization’s overall security. Unlike malicious hackers (often referred to as black-hat hackers), ethical hackers have the permission and approval of the organization they’re hacking into. Their goal is to use the same techniques as cybercriminals to locate potential weaknesses and reinforce an organization’s protection against data breaches and security threats.</p>
